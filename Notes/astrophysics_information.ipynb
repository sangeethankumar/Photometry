    "1. **Characteristic Photon Energy (hν):** Each type of electromagnetic radiation is made up of photons, which are particles of light. The energy of these photons is denoted by ( h $\\nu$ ), where \\( h \\) is Planck's constant and ( $\\nu$) is the frequency of the radiation. Different bands have photons with different energies. For example, X-rays have higher energy photons compared to those of visible light.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Characteristic Temperature (hν/k):** This relates to the temperature of the source emitting the radiation. The formula \\( h $\\nu$ /k \\) (where \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant) gives an idea of the temperature of the object that would emit such radiation. For instance, very hot objects emit more in the ultraviolet and X-ray bands, while cooler objects emit more in the infrared.\n",
